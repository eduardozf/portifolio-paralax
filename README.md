# Parallax Portfolio

## About the Project

I decided to take on a challenge different from what I am used to. I don't have much experience starting a project from the design phase. Usually, I take on projects where I can directly apply my development knowledge since the UI/UX has already been done by a designer.

This time, I created the entire interface and had to build an atmosphere for the site. From the beginning, I knew I wanted something colorful and striking, and my mind immediately thought of Toucans and Macaws. So, I went ahead with this idea.

I also wanted to implement a parallax animation along with the scroll, as I've always admired websites with this concept. For this, the site needed to have at least two sections to apply the effect. Therefore, I created a second FAQ section, which I tried to make lively while maintaining the nature aesthetic.

Despite having only two sections, I believe I achieved a satisfactory result. I hope you like it.

## Technologies Used
To force myself to learn new technologies, I chose to use Next.js and Tailwind CSS for this project. I believe I didn't use the full potential of Next.js for this project, and I will reserve it for larger projects in the future.

- **Next.js**
- **GSAP**
- **Tailwind CSS**
